        "Forged from a single piece of WÜSTHOF steel, the precision-sharpened, 8-inch blade makes this knife agile, intuitive, and easy to handle. A full bolster – the thicker area between the blade and the handle on forged knives – further protects your fingers during slicing and dicing. The custom-grained Calabrian olive wood handle is naturally water-resistant and antibacterial, and its organic shape fits comfortably in hands of any size.",

        "Consider the chef's knife the hero of your kitchen — it's an all-rounder in food preparation that supports the widest variety of kitchen tasks. A great chef's knife makes slicing and dicing a pleasure, which is one of the many reasons it is often the most used, most important kitchen tool for home cooks and professional chefs. Precision forged from a single piece of WÜSTHOF steel by our expert knife artisans in Solingen, Germany, each Performer blade is enhanced by an elegant, black Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coating. This DLC coating makes our steel exceptionally strong and durable, producing a long-lasting blade that is heat resistant, scratch proof, and resilient to damage, even after frequent use in your kitchen. (It also makes Performer blades largely water-repellent, mimicking the moisture-beading effect you might see on the sleeve of your rain jacket.) Handles are fitted with our innovative, ergonomic Hexagon Power Grip, a non-slip honeycomb design that guarantees each slicing moment is safe, comfortable, and precise. Combining centuries of expert artisanship with cutting-edge technology, the WÜSTHOF Performer 6inch Chef's Knife is an ideal addition to any kitchen.",
